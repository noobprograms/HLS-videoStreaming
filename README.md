# HTTP Live Streaming NODE.JS and AWS
This is an example implementation of HTTP Live Streaming in Node.js, Lambda, Fargate, and S3

This repository contains the frontend code in React.js

This also contains the backend code. This is not the backend for this site which is being used. I implemented this backend to do video transcoding locally before i added it to cloud. The routes and methods used in the backend file 
are only for example.
